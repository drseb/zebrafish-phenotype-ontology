# Files in the src/curation directory

Most files in the src/curation directory are generated by the automated curation pipeline scripts in src/scripts. More information can be found in the respective README there. The following files are important to the automated curation process of ZFIN EQ annotations to ZP defined classes in OWL:

- id_map.tsv_removed.tsv: These are 140 mappings involving a total of 74 ZP ids that were used in previous versions of the ZP, but are now excluded because their mapping to ZFIN EQs was ambiguous. EQs in ZFIN that were mapped that way now have new ids. However, just to be save, it makes sense to try and avoid re-using the 74 ZP ids in this file -> they should be added to reserved_iris.txt before any automatic curation task is run.
- id_map.tsv: This is the most important file part of the pipeline containing the stable mapping between EQ annotations and ZP identifiers.
- id_map.tsv_incomplete.tsv: This file contains a few ZP-EQ mappings that were previously constructed by the old ZP pipeline, but do not have corresponding records in the current ZFIN EQ data. There is a choice whether to add those to the manually curated ZP classes. Use this file only for constructing the reserved_iri.txt, just in case (albeit unlikely), someone somewhere used the ZP classes in here for something.
- deprecated_id_map.tsv: This file documents those ZP to ZFIN EQ mappings that could be found one day, but not anymore. It can be safely ignored; Mappings in this file are NOT excluded from the main mapping file, as the assumption is that once an ZFIN EQ mapping was made in the past, it constitutes a valid precomposed ZP class. However, this file can be reviewed from time to time to see whether any classes need to be manually deprecated.
- kb_zp.ttl: ZFIN gene annotations as RDF with reference to ZP identifiers. Queryable (see pipeline for more details)
- reserved_iris.txt: This file is not up-to-date and MUST be regenerated every time before the pipeline is run.
- pattern_assignments.tsv: This file contains the mapping of ZP ids to their corresponding ZFIN base pattern. This file is not used anywhere and is there purely for documentation/reference purposes (generated by zp_dosdp.py).
- zp_annotations_to_iri.tsv: A table that contains the ZFIN GENE-EQ annotations with reference to their corresponding ZP classes.
